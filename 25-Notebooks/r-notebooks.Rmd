## Outline

1. Background: Data Analysis Workflow
2. R Notebooks
3. Demo
4. Q&A

## Level 1: Typical new R analyst 

![](images/level-1.png)

<div class="notes">
New R users often just work in the console. They have an ad-hoc conversation with R. This is fine for early exploratory analysis, but it has a serious drawback: it is not reproducible. It's hard to see what you did, what the output was, and why you did it. 
</div>

## Level 2: Experienced R analyst

<div class="notes">
This is where most R users are today. Instead of writing R code in the console, you write it in the script editor. This is much better because your analysis is now documented and repeatable and shareable. It still has a couple of flaws, though:

- R output is disconnected from input; has to be saved separately
- Export/copy/paste needed for final use
- Documentation and context are usually sparse or absent
</div>

## Level 3: Literate R analyst

<div class="notes">
R Markdown is a tool for composing data analaysis using literate programming. We won't focus on it much in this presentation, but it solves all of the above problems. It lets you write a document that includes runnable R code, and create a polished, professional output document. R Markdown alone can be frustrating to use for data analysis, though:

- Iterating on code is no better than it was in level 2 -- you still need to keep the console and viewer windows open
- Look at how complex this is getting!
</div>

## Level 4: Introducing R Notebooks

<div class="notes">
A goal of R Notebooks is to give you all the power of R Markdown with all of the immediacy and fun you had back at level 1. In an R Notebook, you can write your analyses and see the results, in real time, below the code.

## R Notebooks Summary

1. Interact with R in a **single, seamless stream**.
1. **Iterate quickly** on code and output; see code and output together. 
1. Leave a **clean, reproducible record** of your analysis in a simple text file.
1. Document your analysis with **rich, literate prose**.
1. **Share and publish** easily.
1. **One-click export** to PDF, Word, etc.

# Demo

## Compared with Jupyter

- Different interaction model (cells vs. text)
- First-class support for R, some support for other "kernels"
- Plain text format is more amenable to version control
- No special viewer required 
- Cross-render to final output

## Advanced topics

- Execution queue control
- Notebooks in RStudio Server
- Version control
- Rendering & hooks from other R front ends
