```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

top_10 <- c("United States", "United Kingdom", "Germany", "France", 
            "Japan", "Italy", "China", "India", "Canada", "Brazil")
```

## Gapminder data

### gapminder 

The `gapminder` data set contains demographic statistics popularized by Hans Rosling's TED talks.

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE}
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

### Goal

Which countries had the fastest growing GDP's between 1952 and 2007?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/goal.png")
```

## The Tidyverse

### Functions

In R, you manipulate data by passing the data to functions.

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE}
round(1234.567, digits = 2)
nrow(gapminder)
```

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that contain functions. You must load the packages to use the functions.

### Load the Tidyverse

```{r ex3, exercise = TRUE}
## install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```

### Tidy Tools

Tidyverse functions are designed to be:

1. **Simple** - They do one thing, and they do it  well
2. **Composable** - They can be combined with other functions for multi-step operations

### Which countries have the largest populations?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/arrange.png")
```

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/desc.png")
```

```{r ex4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder
```

```{r ex4-solution}
arrange(gapminder, desc(pop))
```

### Which countries had the largest population _in 2007_?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/filter.png")
```

```{r ex5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder2007 <- gapminder
gapminder2007
```

```{r ex5-solution}
gapminder2007 <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)
arrange(gapminder2007, desc(pop))
```


### A better way

Use the pipe operator (%>%) to compose tidyverse functions.

```{r ex6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder2007 <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)
arrange(gapminder2007, desc(pop))
```

```{r ex6-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop))
```


### Which countries had the largest life expectancy in 2007?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/select.png")
```

```{r ex7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder
```

```{r ex7-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifeExp)) %>% 
  select(country, lifeExp)
```

### What is the gdp of each country?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mutate.png")
```

```{r ex8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder
```

```{r ex8-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```


### What was the maximum gdp?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/summarise.png")
```

```{r ex9, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

```{r ex9-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  summarise(max_gdp = max(gdp))
```

### What was the first gdp? The last gdp?

```{r ex10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

```{r ex10-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  summarise(first_gdp = first(gdp), last_gdp = last(gdp))
```

### What was the first and last gdp for each country?

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/group_by.png")
```

```{r ex11, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  summarise(first_gdp = first(gdp), last_gdp = last(gdp))
```

```{r ex11-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(first_gdp = first(gdp), last_gdp = last(gdp))
```

### What was the cumulative annual growth for each country between 1952 and 1957?

```{r ex12, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(gdp1952 = first(gdp), gdp2007 = last(gdp))
```

```{r ex12-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(gdp1952 = first(gdp), gdp2007 = last(gdp)) %>% 
  mutate(cagr = ((gdp2007 / gdp1952) ^ (1/55) - 1) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cagr)) %>% 
  select(country, cagr)
```

### Tidy data

Each tidyverse function expects and returns the same type of data: _tidy data_. 
A tabular data set is tidy iff:

1. Each variable is in its own column
2. Each observation is in its own row

## Visualization

### What did GDP growth look like?

Let's focus on the 10 biggest economies (in 1952). What are they?

```{r ex13, exercise = TRUE}
gapminder
```

```{r ex13-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp)) %>% 
  select(country, gdp)
```

### Visualize the Top 10

```{r}
top_10 <- c("United States", "United Kingdom", "Germany", "France", 
            "Japan", "Italy", "China", "India", "Canada", "Brazil")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

```{r ex14, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder
```

```{r ex14-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = gdp, color = country))
```


### Scaled data

Let's scale the data within each country to make growth easier to compare

```{r ex15, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

```{r ex15-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(scaled_gdp = gdp / first(gdp)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = scaled_gdp, color = country))
```

### Cumulative Annual Growth Rates

```{r ex16, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(start = first(gdp), end = last(gdp)) %>% 
  mutate(cagr = ((end/start) ^ (1 / 55) - 1) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cagr)) %>% 
  select(country, cagr)
```

```{r ex16-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(start = first(gdp), end = last(gdp)) %>% 
  mutate(cagr = ((end/start) ^ (1 / 55) - 1) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cagr)) %>% 
  select(country, cagr) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = country, y = cagr))
```

### Aspirational

```{r ex17, exercise = TRUE}
library(forcats)

gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(start = first(gdp), end = last(gdp)) %>% 
  mutate(cagr = ((end/start) ^ (1 / 55) - 1) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cagr)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(country, cagr), y = cagr)) +
    labs(x = "Country", y = "Cumulative Annual Growth Rate in GDP (1952-2007)") +
    coord_flip()
```
