Webinar Guide
================
So you want to make a great webinar? Use this helpful checklist.

Title Card
=======
Make your first slide a title card that contains:
1. the webinar title
2. a subtitle (optional)
3. your name
4. the date
5. links to any resources
6. a copyright (CC-BY-4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 

This will let the viewer know they are in the right place, and will help us edit the webinar for Youtube, etc.

Resources and Links
================
Make the resources that you use in the webinar available online, preferrably here at https://github.com/rstudio/webinars.

Please use the same naming convention for you files.

Use a Rebrandly rstd.io URL shortener to create your links. This has two benefits:
1. You can update the location of the resources at a later time, without needing to update the link in the video (videos are hard to edit). 
2. RStudio can track the download statistics for the link. 

Do not use bit.ly or tinyurl, as they do not have these features. 

Sections
================
To make your webinar easier to follow (and to reuse as short videos), divide the webinar into clearly marked sections. For each section:
- Focus the section on a specific topic
- Begin the section with its own title card that states the topic
- Pause speaking briefly on the section-title card when presenting the webinar. This will give viewers a chance to read the topic and mentally transition from the previous topic. It also makes it easy for us to provide links to the beginning of each section, and to divide the webinar into short videos at the section dividers.


Longevity
================
More people will view your webinar after you present it than will view it live. To make your webinar useful to these latecomers, mention (at some point):
- when the webinar was recorded
- how the content and best practices in the webinar may change in the next few years. 
- where users can find updates related to the software covered (should they occur)

This will ensure that your content will stay useful for as long as possible. 

Clarity
================
To make your webinar easy to understand, consider these tips:
1. Provide an outline at the start of the webinar that explains what you will cover and in which order (this is particularly useful for people who view the webinar later as they may wish to jump around)
2. Divide your webinar into cohesive sections
3. Summarize the main points of each section at the end of the section
4. Summarize the main points of the webinar at the end of the webinar
5. Webinars are a visual medium if you can clarify a concept with a diagram or animation, do so. 
6. As you prepare your slides, keep in mind that the viewer may watch your presentation on their phone, so please make the most important text big enough to see on small screens.   

Wrapping Up
================
At the end of your portion of the webinar, please conclude and thank the viewers for joining you.  After you’ve finished that sentence, then hand the webinar back to the moderator for their conclusion.  This will give us a good edit point to end the video (we cut it after you say the thank yous, but before the moderator comes back on.)
